classdef opLInterp2D < opSpot
% 2D linear Lagrange interpolation.
%
% use:
%   op = opLInterp2D(x1,y1,X2)
% 
% input:
%   x1 (fast dim),y1 (slow dim) - rectangular input grid (i.e., [0:10:1000],[0:10:1000])
%   X2 = [x2 y2]                - list of evaluation points in N x 2 matrix
%
% input grid may also be non-equidistant. Output outside of the domain is set to zero.
% It's faster to use a Kronecker of opLInterp1D when evaluating on a
% rectangular grid.
